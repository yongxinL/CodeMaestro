- 🔴 >25% change: Critical regression

---

## Compliance & Ethics (Phase 4-5)

- Changelog generated
- Version tagged

---

### Generate Changelog
Create changelog from git history.

**Say:** "Generate changelog" / "What changed since last release?" / "Release notes"

---

### GO/NO-GO Decision
Evaluate release readiness.

**Say:** "GO or NO-GO?" / "Release decision" / "Should we release?"

**Factors:**
- Quality gates status
- Security scan results
- Test coverage
- Performance baselines
- Outstanding issues

---

### Framework Cleanup
Remove CodeMaestro files before delivery.

**Say:** "Clean up framework files" / "Prepare for delivery" / "Remove CodeMaestro"

**Modes:**
- "Verify cleanup" - Show what would be removed
- "Apply cleanup" - Remove with confirmation
- "Validate build" - Check artifacts are clean

---

## Retrospective (Phase 5)

Capture lessons from the project.

**Say:** "Lessons learned" / "What did we learn?" / "Retrospective"

**Categories:**
- What went well
- What could improve
- Process improvements
- Technical discoveries

---

### Token Retrospective
Analyze token usage across project.
